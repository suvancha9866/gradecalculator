# Grade Calculator

This is a Grade Calculator. The idea came to me after using the RapidTables Grade Calculator (https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/grade-calculator.html).

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign doesn't have a localized place to check your grades so you have to manually calculate them. I was irritated that I had to do this everytime for each class. So I wanted to make a Dynamic Grade Calculator based on the one from Rapid Tables for the multiple classes that I have so that I have a way to look at my grades based on my assignments. This way I have control over the entire thing and can know what I need.

This is just for my own happiness and I know it is basic, but I wanted to use this. I had a preliminary one on Excel, but this seemed like a better challenge.

Thank you for supporting me!
