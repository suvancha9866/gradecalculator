# Grade Calculator

This is a Grade Calculator. The idea came to me after using the RapidTables Grade Calculator (https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/grade-calculator.html).

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign doesn't have a localized place to check your grades so you have to manually calculate them. I was irritated that I had to do this everytime for each class. So I wanted to make a Dynamic Grade Calculator based on the one from Rapid Tables for the multiple classes that I have so that I have a way to look at my grades based on my assignments. This way I have control over the entire thing and can know what I need.

This is just for my own happiness and I know it is basic, but I wanted to use this. I had a preliminary one on Excel, but this seemed like a better challenge.

I did all of the front-end/design and all of the backend was by Chat GPT. I hate Javascript so I didn't even bother to learn.

Thank you for supporting me!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
